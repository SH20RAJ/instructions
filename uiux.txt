in the next few minutes we'll teach you
all the important stuff you need to know
about ux UI design we've condensed hours
of training into this short but
impactful video by the end you'll have
practical skills you can use right away
let's dive in first things first what is
ux UI design user experience or ux
design is about the overall feel of the
experience and how a user interacts with
a product ux design is concerned with
the entire Journey a user takes this
includes understanding user needs
defining user flows and creating
wireframes among other steps the primary
objective of ux design is to create a
product that is intuitive efficient and
enjoyable to use user interface or UI
design focuses primarily on the visual
elements that users interact with on a
digital platform this includes
typography spacing colors icons and
other graphical elements the goal of UI
design is to create an intuitive and
Visually appealing interface that
provides a SE less experience for the
user in a nutshell ux makes an app
enjoyable while UI makes it beautiful
and trust me you need both to create
something people will love using now
let's get into tools figma is currently
the most popular tool among designers
it's web-based allows for realtime
collaboration and is easy to learn one
of the first things you'll want to do in
any project is set up a frame a frame is
basically your canvas it's where all
your Design Elements live with your
frame ready this is where you can start
building out your user interface you can
easily add text shapes and images
throughout this video I'll be designing
a Marketplace for digital products this
will give you a firsthand look at how to
navigate the entire design process from
start to finish design thinking is a
widely used user- centered process with
five key stages empathize Define id8
prototype and test the process isn't
linear you can go back to previous
stages as you gain more insights there
are also many more design processes and
Frameworks that you might come across
before we jump into the stages of design
thinking it's worth noting that while
we're covering all the essentials in
this video there's so much more to learn
to master uxui design for that we've
created a uxui design Mastery course
that covers everything you need to
become a professional we've condensed
the best of everything we've learned
into this powerful course drawing from
years of experience designing successful
products so you can shortcut that
process and save yourself years of
frustration our course goes beyond just
Theory we equip you with all the figma
skills you need to create stunning well
organized Pixel Perfect designs you can
find the link in the description below
the video now let's get into the first
stage of design thinking empathize
before you design anything you need to
know who you're designing for you might
start with user interviews where you ask
open-ended questions this allows you to
delve into user experiences and needs on
a more personal level the goal is to
really get into users heads and
understand their needs pain points and
what they value from the data gathered
you can create user personas user
Journey Maps Affinity diagrams and much
more the defined stage is where you
figure out the main problem you're going
to solve and for that you need a problem
statement a good problem statement must
be specific a bad example might be
people need a way to sell digital
products it's not specific enough to
guide your design process effectively a
better more targeted problem statement
could be independent creators need a way
to reach a wider a audience and handle
transactions securely when selling
digital products that's specific it
pinpoints a problem and identifies a
user group giving you a clear road map
for design so the question you and your
team should ask now is how might we
create a digital product Marketplace
that empowers online creators to reach a
wider audience while ensuring secure
transactions here we're entering the id8
stage the goal is simple come up with as
many ideas as you can use whiteboards
sticky notes or digital tool tools like
Meo to quickly write down all your ideas
some designers also start creating
wireframes during the ideation stage the
main purpose of wireframes is to define
the dimensions and placement of page
elements information architecture
intended behaviors and navigation you
can begin with either low Fidelity or
mid-fidelity wireframes low Fidelity
wireframes are quite basic focusing
primarily on layout and functionality
they serve as the skeleton of your
design and are perfect for rough drafts
and quick internal discussions mid
Fidelity wireframes are more advanced
including UI elements like buttons input
fields and placeholder text while still
avoiding
details as your ideas start taking shape
and you narrow down your choices you'll
want to transition to High Fidelity
wireframes that closely mirror what the
final design will look like making them
ideal for detailed user testing you can
kick off user testing during the
ideation or prototyping stage but it's
generally more valuable when you test
with high fidelity wireframes if the
feedback is positive in alignance with
your objectives you're ready to
transform these High Fidelity wireframes
into actual designs this is where things
get exciting the core difference between
a high fidelity wireframe and a
prototype is interactivity this includes
clickable buttons Transitions and even
complex animations Now's the Time to
finalize the user interface add the
colors fonts and other design elements
that will make your design visually
appealing after your prototype is ready
go for another round of user testing
often how a user interacts with a
complete prototype can reveal issues
that weren't apparent in the wireframe
stage usability testing is your goto
method for this during these tests you
can observe real users as they navigate
through your product the goal is to
identify any parts of your design that
could be confusing or hard to use once
you've conducted usability testing and
made any necessary adjustments to your
design the next step is the developer
handoff this is where you transition
your designs into something that can be
implemented Ed by your development team
to ensure a smooth handoff you'll need
to prepare user interface specifications
they should include detailed information
about the dimensions spacing
responsiveness and interactive elements
in your design essentially it's a
comprehensive guide that enables
developers to bring your vision to life
with code finally the designs are ready
for implementation developers will now
use the UI specs to start building the
actual product turning what was once a
series of wireframes and High Fidelity
designs into a fully functional digital
product and that's it for this video if
you found it helpful make sure to give

you see designers who seem to dominate
the ux UI design world creating stunning
apps and websites that attract thousands
of likes and admiration it feels like
they have a special talent for Designing
things their users instantly love right
the truth is you just don't know what
they know no one has shown you the cheat
codes the secrets that the top 1% of
designers know but you don't however
everything is about to change today
you're going to level up you will learn
a few powerful UI design tips through
practical real life examples that will
show you how to design and think like a
senior uxui designer it's time to go
from a junior or beginner uxui designer
and join the top 1% of designers so if
you're ready to take your design game to
the next level keep watching all right
here's the scenario imagine you're
designing a sleep tracking app your goal
is to collect daily data on how many
hours to use her let's call her Emily
slept last night you also want to assign
a quality rating such as great good
neutral poor or bad based on the number
of hours to help Emily understand how
her sleep duration relates to Sleep
Quality sounds simple enough right let's
look at how a typical Junior designer
might approach this but here's the kind
of design you might see from someone
just starting out clean straightforward
navigation check big title at the top
that says how long would you say you
slept yesterday check below that we've
got five options Emily can choose from
ranging from great to bad each linked to
a specific number of sleep hours these
selections are made with radio buttons
and the selected state is highlighted in
the app's primary color now at first
glance you might be thinking hey this
works and sure it's it does the job it's
functional it's clean and the design is
easy to follow but hold on let's think
about it is this the kind of app that's
going to Delight Emily and keep her
engaged every single day does it make
her feel something or is it just another
simple data entry task does this design
accurately represent the goal of helping
Emily understand how her sleep duration
affects her overall quality of rest I
think we know the answer to that now
let's take a look at how a slightly more
experienced designer would approach this
design how about something like this
this already looks much better right
let's understand why first let's talk
about the title we've made two important
changes here
personalization we added hi Emily to
personalize The Experience people
respond more positively when they feel
recognized and even something as simple
as using their name can enhance
engagement clarity and simplicity we
revised the title to how long did you
sleep last night users prefer language
that is conversational and easy to
process and this phrasing feels natural
reducing friction in the interaction now
let's talk about how we reorganized the
layout in the previous version the state
labels great good and bad were more
prominent than the actual hours slept
but here we've shifted the emphasis to
the hours this follows the principle of
visual hierarchy where the most critical
information the hours is given more
prominence the state labels still
provide useful feedback but they are
secondary this ensures that users focus
on inputting the correct number of hours
first before reflecting on the quality
the radio buttons are now placed on the
left side this aligns with the F pattern
in natural reading order which users are
accustomed to by placing the interaction
controls on the left we ensure use can
quickly and intuitively make their
selection without unnecessary eye
movement or cognitive load we've added
emojis next to each sleep option to make
the experience more fun and relatable
instead of just numbers and words the
Emojis bring a bit of personality to the
app making it easier for users to
connect emotionally with their choices
the Emojis also visually reinforce the
idea that more sleep leads to better
outcomes for example a happy Emoji is
tied to longer sleep while an upset
Emoji is linked to Shorter durations
this makes it easy for users to
instantly understand what each option
represents encouraging healthier sleep
habits in a way that feels natural and
engaging we've also made the selected
State much more distinct by changing the
text color and making the Emoji larger
for the selected option we're adding
system feedback good feedback lets users
know their input has been registered and
provides a satisfying resp responsive
interaction all right this design was a
step up from the first one but we're not
done yet let's take it to the next level
and create an interface that feels not
only functional but also fun and
intuitive to interact with how about
something like this instead of a basic
list we now have a curved slider that
makes the experience more fun and
engaging it feels less like filling out
a form and more like a journey letting
Emily slide through her options in a
natural satisfying way Emily can swipe
between sleep options making the
experience more intuitive and satisfying
than clicking a button swiping feels
natural on mobile devices making the
interaction smoother and more mobile
friendly the selected option is now
entered and enlarged making it clear
which sleep duration Emily has chosen
the size contrast guides her Focus
reducing confusion the large emoji and
bold text give immediate feedback is
this the only other option no it's not
let's look at something different to
make it feel even more personal for
Emily what about this design in this
version the selected state is now front
and center right in the middle making it
the most prominent part of the screen
this isn't just a small detail it's an
essential part of the design when Emily
selects an option it's highlighted
visually with the larger emoji that
gives immediate feedback the Emoji in
the middle not only shills Emily
selection but it also reinforces her
choice with positive feedback whether
her sleep was good or something else
this centralized feedback combined with
encouraging text like your sleep was
good aimed for 8 hours for the best rest
makes the experience more motivational
and informative for Emily as Emily
selects different options both the Emoji
and the feedback change dynamically this
adds an element of fun and
personalization the app isn't just
collect data it's giving realtime
responses that help Emily understand her
sleep patterns better now let me show
you one more option for Designing this
experience in this design the selected
Emoji stays right in the middle giving
Emily immediate visual feedback about
how well she slept but this time we've
taken it up a notch by adding a slider
below the Emoji making the experience
more interactive for Emily as Emily
slides through the Sleep durations the
Emoji and feedback text dynamically
change in real time creating a more
engaging experience for instance here
she can see that she slept 2 hours more
than the night before which adds a layer
of personalization and helps Emily feel
more connected to her progress this type
of interaction brings Emily closer to
her sleep data making it feel more like
a personal Journey rather than just a
task compare this to the previous design
I think this version takes interaction
to the next level now I want to make
this video a bit more interactive for
you too pause the video and tell me in
the comments which design I designed you
like the most and add a reason why do
you prefer option A for its clean and
simple design is option b more your
style with its Dynamic swipeable
interaction maybe you like option C for
its Emoji selection and encouraging
feedback or does option D stand out with
its interactive slider and sleep
comparison I'm really curious to hear
which one stands out to you and why
write it in the comments I've got even
more tips for you in this video but as
you've seen so far even small tweaks can
turn a good design into a great one the
reality is becoming a great designer
takes years of learning and even then
you might still be missing some key
elements to consistently create
beautiful designs that's exactly why we
created the UI ux Playbook a
comprehensive guide packed with over 100
actionable tips principles and
strategies that can take your designs to
the next level and save you many years
of frustration and failures The Playbook
has received five-star reviews from more
than 10,000 people who have already
downloaded the free preview or grab the
full version don't miss out on this
opportunity to learn how to create
beautiful designs yourself just click
the link in the description to get your
copy and if you stay until the end I'll
give you a special gift now let's shift
gears and take a look at the world of
Finance picture something like this
you've designed a stunning banking app
with a clean modern interface that users
love imagine the possibilities when your
app not only looks great but also offers
a seamless user experience you can find
the full tutorial for creating this
beautiful banking app design including
the source files in our ux UI design
Mastery course now imagine you need to
design payment experience a flow where
users can easily transfer money to their
friends Michaela Jenny and Rachel so
let's get back to our home on our mobile
app and click on at the bottom to go to
the transfer screen to see how an
average Junior designer would design it
we have a basic layout with two buttons
and redundant text it's a simple design
that you can say in a way works but
let's see how a more senior designer
would design this experience this is
much better now let's compare this to a
design from a junior designer instead of
cluttering the screen with unnecessary
text or multiple options we've used the
space more efficiently we added a recent
recipient section along with the search
bar by doing this we eliminated the need
for a separate choose from history
button and streamlined it to just one
clear call to action this design Choice
does a few key things it lets users see
people they've recently transferred
money to making the process faster and
more intuitive it reduces interaction
cost a key the UI design principle
you'll learn about in our UI ux Playbook
every unnecessary action you remove from
the process improves the user experience
this senior level design not only looks
cleaner but it also leverages important
ux principles to create a more seamless
and userfriendly experience so let's
dive deeper into the transaction process
now imagine your app supports
transferring funds in different
currencies here's how a junior designer
might approach design of the transfer
screen there are two separate Fields one
for selecting the currency and another
for entering the transfer amount this
layout works and technically it gets the
job done but it's not optimized for the
user's experience now let's see how I
would improve this what about this this
instantly feels better first you need to
think from the users's perspective
what's the most important task they want
to complete entering the transfer amount
so I've made this the focus of the
screen making it larger and more
prominent to immediately draw the user's
attention on the other hand selecting
the currency is a secondary action the
currency selector is tucked neatly into
the corner of the amount input field
making it available but not distracting
this assumes the user will most likely
transfer money in the same currency most
of the time so the emphasis remains on
the amount this minimizes distractions
and keeps the interface Focus focused on
the task at hand now let's take it a
step further and enhance the user
experience even more how would you do
that I would do it by giving users a
clear visual cue of who they're sending
money to incorporating a profile photo
or even just an icon next to the
recipient's name an account number does
more than just personalize the
transaction it Taps into the principle
of recognition over recall instead of
having to remember specific details like
account numbers users can quickly
recognize familiar faces or icons making
the process more intuitive and reliable
this subtle addition helps users feel
confident that they're sending money to
the right person reducing the risk of
accidental transfers now we can take
this a step further by adding your new
balance section directly after the
transfer amount this addition gives
users instant feedback on how the
transaction will affect their account
balance so not only does it allow them
to see their current balance but it also
shows what their New Balance will be
after the transaction is complete this
improves transparency and helps users
feel more in control of their finances
minimizing any surprises after sending
money sadly you will find that many
banking apps miss this feature now let's
imagine the user has multiple accounts
perhaps a business account a personal
account or even a joint account in this
scenario it's important to clearly show
which account the payment is coming from
to avoid any confusion we can Implement
a simple yet effective solution
displaying both the sender account and
the recipient's account prominently
during the transaction this ensures the
user knows exactly which account will be
deducted whether it's their personal
business or joint account by doing this
we give the user a clear overview of
their accounts and reduce the chance of
Errors they can easily switch between
accounts before finalizing the
transaction making the process both
intuitive and flexible you can really
see the big difference in how a Junior
and senior designer would approach the
same experience as a senior uxui
designer Your Role goes beyond just
creating visually appealing designs you
have a deep understanding of your target
audience their needs frustrations and
motivations you step into their shoes
considering the environment and context
in which they'll use your product by
doing this you don't just design
interfaces you craft intuitive user
centered experiences that solve real
problems and make interaction seamless
now let's move on to the final tip offer
selection instead of manual input
imagine your designing an onboarding
screen for your product and you want to
ask the user for their job title here's
how an average designer might handle
this this design has a text field where
the user has to manually type in their
answer while it gets the job done it's
not the best approach why because it
requires more effort from the user and
introduces the possibility of tyos
inconsistent responses or frustration
with thinking of the right title now
let's see how a senior uxui designer
would handle this instead of a manual
input field I would add a selection of
the most common job titles users can
simply tap their role making the process
faster and easier I also brought in some
personality by incorporating icons next
to each option for those whose job title
wasn't listed we included another option
allowing them to either input their own
title or select it as a general option
when designing you can play with
different layouts to add more visual
appeal But ultimately you always have to
prioritize the user experience we put a
lot of effort into creating this video
and it would mean the world to us if you
could support it by sharing or leaving a
comment and because you you stayed until
the end I have a special offer for you
use code awesome 50 to get 50% off on

hello and welcome back because you loved
our first video on top UI design tips
we've created part two for you which
will be even more exciting the truth is
you don't need a design background
special talents or a University degree
to create beautiful UI designs by
mastering the key principles tips and
tricks anyone can create exceptional UI
designs that people love whether you're
a designer developer marketer or simply
curious about UI design these tips are
for you let's dive into today's tips and
keep pushing ing Your Design skills to
the next level tip number one experiment
with creative layouts the traditional
approach of a vertical list of
text-based options can sometimes come
across as Bland and unengaging the
standard layout offers limited
opportunities for visual differentiation
and while it provides Clarity it doesn't
always contribute to a memorable user
experience what if we could break free
from the constraints of the typical list
of options layout an exciting
alternative is to reimagine them as
selectable cards this approach adds a
new layer of interaction and visual
appeal to the user interface each card
can feature labels colors and even icons
or images providing more context and
richness to the options presented such
an approach not only increases the
aesthetic appeal but also AIDS in making
the information more digestible and the
interface more
engaging tip number two reduce user
barrier by exposing content directly
imagine this you're scrolling through a
new app and the first thing you see is a
big banner saying discover 100 plus
recipes selected by our chefs it sounds
exciting but it's also an extra step you
have to tap on it to see the actual
recipes that's the interaction cost in
action which we can Define as the
cognitive physical and time effort a
user has to exert to reach their goal in
today's fast-paced world users are
looking for immediate value by hiding
content behind banners you're creating
an unnecessary barrier between the user
and the value your app provides
this interaction cost may seem trivial
but it can add up especially when the
user is new to the app and unsure about
investing time and effort in it instead
imagine this you open the same app but
this time you immediately see a curated
list of top 10 recommended recipes no
tapping needed the content is right
there this does a couple of things it
adds quick value the user instantly sees
the value your app provides making them
more likely to engage further it reduces
friction
the fewer steps a user has to take to
reach their goal the better the user
experience that means increased user
attention and more interaction within
your app it adds relevancy when you
expose content directly you have the
opportunity to showcase the most
relevant or popular items making it more
likely that the user will find something
that interests them right away tip
number three design for the thumb Zone
mobile devices are often operated using
just one hand and primarily the thumb
therefore when you're designing a mobile
interface it's important to keep the tum
zones in mind this is the area of the
screen easily reachable with the thumb
placing key elements like buttons
navigation links and calls to action
within the thumb Zone makes it easier
for users to interact with your Design
Elements positioned outside of this area
can be difficult to reach and could lead
to user frustration or misclicks so when
you're laying out your design make sure
the most used features are easily
accessible within the thumb Zone by
doing so you enhance usability and make
your interface more userfriendly let's
have a look at two UI design examples in
the first screen the CTA is located
outside of the thumb Zone which means
that users would need to stretch or
adjust their grip to reach it this can
cause frustration and inconvenience
especially for users who are on the go
or have limited mobility in the second
screen the CTA is thoughtfully
positioned within the thumb Zone which
is a common area where users thumbs
naturally rest when holding their mobile
devices tip number four turn empty
States into opportunities when a user
encounters an empty State it's like
hitting a roadblock an empty screen with
no guidance or actionable steps can
leave them feeling lost and frustrated
it's a missed opportunity to guide and
engage users a bare empty State such as
a screen simply saying you have no
projects fails to provide users with any
value or Direction it's a dead end that
can make users feel stuck and unsure of
what to do next next conversely a
well-designed empty State can be a
powerful tool to educate engage and
encourage users to take action it's a
chance to turn a potential negative
experience into a positive one for
example an empty state that says start
managing your projects and stay
organized immediately offers a solution
to the user's problem it doesn't stop
there though with an accompanying
illustration it becomes visually
appealing and less daunting by adding
actionable tips like invite team members
to collaborate on a project for better
communication and set deadlines for
tasks to keep everyone on track it
provides clear steps for the user to
take finally a CTA button saying create
new project gives them a direct way to
take action last but not least tip
number five use visual
cues we could have presented all these
tips in a Texton format but we chose to
use visual examples why because visuals
make your learning and any user's
interaction with a design far more
engaging and memorable visual cues do
more than just add flare or personality
to your designs they help users
understand your message faster and
enhance overall user experience by
making information easier to grasp to
show the impact visual cues can have
compare the following designs the first
one without the visual cues versus the
second one with the visual cues a huge
difference right now let's have a look
at another example of using visual cues
to design better UI for email messages
in the first design you can see a UI
that doesn't apply the principle of
visual cues while this UI design is
functional there are opportunities to
enhance the user experience and improve
the overall usability of the email inbox
even more using icons with a set of
colors and a first initial letter in the
middle could be a creative and Visually
appealing way to represent senders in an
email inbox or messaging app a more
effective way to represent senders is to
use images of people and logos of
companies with that users can easily
identify the sender and quickly
understand the context of the message
